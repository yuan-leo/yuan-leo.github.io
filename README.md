# My just crummy website (V4)
- made a bunch of changes to the mondrian design:
	- added dialogs to hide clutter
	- fixed a bunch of bugs
	- added tests & content

# My even more crummy website (V3)
- added a triclops landing page

# My even more crummy website (V2)
- randomly generated mondrian-style design
- looks different every time
- built from scratch
- not HTML4/old browser friendly at all
- probably looks bad on mobile

# My kinda crummy website (V1)

- built with some crappy WYSIWYG editor in 10 mins
- has really great copy
- has really bad autogenerated code
- parts that were outright broken have been fixed
- top quality engineering
- no tests
